            I tried to make the installation of the application as simple as possible. <br><br>

            1. Extract the contents of the archive into the root directory of the site <br>
            2. Set the rights to the file <strong>CONFIG.INI</strong> (666 or 777) <br>
            3. Set permissions on the <strong>IMAGES</strong> folder (777) <br>
            4. Go to http://yoursite.com <br>

        <div class="callout-block callout-info">
            Hereinafter, <strong>yoursite.com</strong> means your domain
        </div>


        Fill in the form:<br><br>

        <strong>MySQL User</strong> - MySQL user name (check with your hosting provider)<br>
        <strong>MySQL Password</strong> - MySQL user password (check with your hosting provider)<br>
        <strong>MySQL Host</strong> - the address of the MySQL server (in most cases this is “localhost”)<br>
        <strong>MySQL DB name</strong> - is the name of the MySQL database, the installer will try to create a database
        with this name.<br><br>


        <div class="callout-block callout-info">
            Note that on some hosting sites this may not work. You may need to create the database yourself in the
            server /
            hosting management panel.
        </div>

        If you created a database in the hosting control panel, just add its name in the field <strong>“MySQL DB
        name”</strong><br>

        <strong>Admin Email</strong> - Email administrator. Your email to enter the control panel.<br>
        <strong>Admin Password</strong> - Create a password to enter the control panel. The password is at least 8
        characters long.<br>

        Press the <strong>“INSTALL”</strong> button. This completes the installation.
        </p>

        <div class="callout-block callout-danger">
            <strong>Attention!</strong><br>

            You cannot install a script in a subfolder (this is a limitation of the codeigniter framework). Use a subdomain instead of a subfolder.<br><br>

            Wrong: <strong>site.com/subfolder/</strong><br>
            Right: <strong>subdomain.site.com</strong><br><br>

            Do not use the combination of the letters <strong>"ad", "ads", "advert"</strong> in the name of the domain or subdomain, so as not to fall under AdBlock filters
